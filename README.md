# 99 Bottles of Beer Ruby Challenge
Welcome to the 99 Bottles of Beer Ruby Challenge repository! This project is inspired by the classic folk song "99 Bottles of Beer" and aims to provide a platform for Ruby developers to showcase their problem-solving skills, creativity, and grasp of different programming paradigms, especially Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## About the Challenge
The "99 Bottles of Beer" song is a traditional reverse counting song, often sung on road trips, as it has a very repetitive tune that's easy to memorize. In the Ruby programming world, it's become a beloved challenge that helps developers practice loops, conditionals, methods, string interpolation, and especially OOP concepts.
I was quizzed on this in a job interview and I thought it was a fun challenge, hence this repo.

## Inspired by Sandi Metz's "99 Bottles of OOP"
This challenge also pays homage to Sandi Metz's book, "[99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)," which is a deep dive into the principles of object-oriented design. It uses the song's concept as a case study to explore writing maintainable, scalable, and beautiful code.
